"sunChapterTwoTitle" = "Feeling the Sun";
"sunChapterTwoContent" = "Well, we've arrived at the sun. The Sun is a very large mass of gas consisting of hydrogen and helium. The temperature is too hot to stay in a solid or liquid state. In fact, the center of the sun rises to 15,700,000 degrees. The sun is so hot and bright that you can't look at the sun with your bare eyes from Earth.";
"sunChapterThreeTitle" = "The Sun from afar";
"sunChapterThreeContent" = "This time, let's leave the hot sun and feel at the huge sun from a very far distance. There are spots on the surface of the sun that are particularly different from other regions. Sun spots and sun flares are indispensable for the sun. When a lot of energy is accumulated in the sun due to fusion, it erupts, and it suddenly bursts onto the surface. Try and focus on the sunspot to feel this phenomenon.";

The moon, which is thought to have been created when Mars-sized boy collided with the earth, is 3.7 times smaller than the earth. If the Earth is the size of a U.S. nickel, the Earth's tiny companion Moon, is about the size of a pea. Did you get a feel for the size of the moon? Still, Earth’s moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. Shall we travel to the moon from now on?";
"moonChapterTwoTitle" = "The sea of the moon";
"moonChapterTwoContent" = "Early astronomers thought the dark spots on the moon's surface were the moon's seas and named them Mare, which means the sea in Latin. Later, the moon's sea was found to be a plain created by a volcanic eruption and was not related to the Earth's sea, but it is still called Mare. Stop by the Sea of Tranquility among the many seas of the moon. The Sea of Tranquility, where the first manned spacecraft Apollo 11 landed is a must-visit tourist destination when you come to the moon.";
"moonChapterThreeTitle" = "Those who went first";
"moonChapterThreeContent" = "The Moon is the only celestial body that humans have visited other than Earth. So far, more than 105  spacecraft have been launched to explore the moon, and 12 people have set foot on it. Look for traces of people who have been there before on the surface of the moon. You can find pieces of equipment left behind by the astronauts, an American flag, a camera, and even footprints left by the Apollo 11 astronauts.";

"mercuryChapterOneTitle" = "Mercury travel essentials";
"mercuryChapterOneContent" = "We have arrived at Mercury, which is very hot because it is close to the sun. In Mercury, which rises to 179℃ during the day, you should be careful not to step on the ground barefoot. Be sure to bring your shoes! A spacesuit with excellent heat dissipation is also a must-have. Don't worry too much if you accidentally burn yourself. Even on Mercury, which is so hot, there is ice in the craters deep in the polar region, where the sunlight does not reach at all. Shall we go to the ice crater and take a break?";
"mercuryChapterTwoTitle" = "Treasure hunt in the basin";
"mercuryChapterTwoContent" = "In addition to craters that contain ice, there is another very popular tourist attraction on Mercury.

Venus has an extreme greenhouse effect because of its thick and dense atmosphere. In fact, the surface temperature of Venus rises to 465°C. Let's find a place to escape the heat and go in.";
"venusChapterThreeTitle" = "A day starting on Venus";
"venusChapterThreeContent" = "When you woke up after sleeping in a place where you could avoid the heat, the sun rises far away.  You can meet very unique natural phenomenon on Venus. That is, the sun rises in the west. It’s because Venus rotates in a clockwise direction unlike earth. Let's feel how different the sun rising in the west is.";

"saturnChapterOneContent" = "Our destination is beautiful Saturn. Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system after Jupiter. It's big enough to hold 765 Earth. It has 100 times the mass of Earth! However, the density is very low, so we cannot land on Saturn’s soil. Don't be too sad if you can't land! There are so many things to find on Saturn without landing.";
"saturnChapterTwoTitle" = "The jewel of the solar system";
"saturnChapterTwoContent" = "There is Saturn with beautiful rings. Getting close to the gorgeous rings is one of the biggest attractions of traveling to Saturn.

"saturnChapterThreeTitle" = "Rivers of Titan";
"saturnChapterThreeContent" = "This time, let's take a trip to the Saturn’s moon. Saturn has 63 moons, of which Titan is larger than Mercury.

You might get motion sickness on Uranus.";
"uranusChapterThreeTitle" = "A cold giant ice planet";
"uranusChapterThreeContent" = "Uranus is called an giant icy planet. Although Uranus has a diameter four times that of Earth and a mass fourteen times that of Earth, it has a weaker gravity than Earth because its density is the lowest in the solar system after Saturn. While Uranus revolves around the sun, 80 years pass on Earth. How will the four seasons of Uranus come to human life? We are looking forward to the next exploration plan for Uranus, which has been attracting the attention of many scientists as an unknown planet for a long time!";
